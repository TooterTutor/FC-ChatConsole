[18:15:14] [Player] MissesLulu I am new to the Plots. So, I may some questions for you.
[18:15:46] [Player] MissesLulu No building in the wilderness, correct?
[18:15:53] [Owner] vanquesh you can build
[18:15:57] [Owner] vanquesh but others can grief
[18:15:57] [Helper] TheREALFoxman11 nope you can build
[18:16:05] [Owner] vanquesh if they find your base
[18:16:36] [Player] MissesLulu Ok. Plots are safe, and the command for plots is /plots?
[18:17:21] [Owner] vanquesh plots are used for lots of different things, inclduing saving locations, so you can save almost any location using /plot save
[18:17:22] [Player] Stay_Froze2808 is no longer afk
[18:17:35] [Info] Players can only take damage in The Wilderness
[18:17:38] [Owner] vanquesh you can also use /plot save <name> to name the plot, and then teleport back later using /plot spawn <name>
[18:17:39] [Player] MissesLulu Is a plot an actual area to build on?
[18:17:52] [Helper] TheREALFoxman11 no thats a settlment
[18:17:58] [Owner] vanquesh You can claim land by creating settlements in The Frontier using emeralds
[18:18:02] [Helper] TheREALFoxman11 they cost 1000 ems
[18:18:05] [Player] MissesLulu Ok.
[18:18:06] Player TooterTutor is no longer online
[18:18:27] [Owner] vanquesh You can also create homes and shops in your settlement
[18:18:39] [Owner] vanquesh You can find claimable plots using /explore unclaimed
[18:18:45] [Player] MissesLulu So, how do I get to where settlements are?
[18:19:04] [Player] MxDoodle you can use /settlement spawn then the name of the settlement
[18:19:12] [Owner] vanquesh you can use /explore unclaimed to find claimable plots
[18:19:24] [Owner] vanquesh you can use /explore settlements to teleport to settlements on the server
[18:19:26] [Helper] TheREALFoxman11 for settlments
[18:19:47] [Player] Drblue03 it would be cool if we programed a tutorial on to the sever for new players!
[18:20:01] [Owner] vanquesh there is a tutorial book
[18:20:04] [Player] MxDoodle pretty sure all that is in the book
[18:20:09] [Owner] vanquesh and we have a tutorial on the website
[18:20:29] [Player] MissesLulu Is this a name of plugin that I can read about? Forgive me, but I am super familiar with claiming with the golden shovel, so I would have to learn about the plots.
[18:20:52] [Player] MissesLulu I have the book. I quickly read through it, but I will look again.
[18:21:10] [Owner] vanquesh The plugin is custom, all the info you need to know is documented on our website use /server links
[18:21:25] [Player] MissesLulu Ok, thank you.
[18:21:32] [Owner] vanquesh No problem happy to help
[18:21:39] [Helper] TheREALFoxman11 wait van can you get banned?
